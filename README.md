Class [CS 5610 Web Development Fall 2021](https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_fall_2021/_)

## Project Objective:

The purpose of this project is to utilize Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and HTML/CSS/JS skills to build a responsive website which could be used by people across the world.  Our project was to build a fitness scheduling website, in which users would create accounts, create workouts to be scheduled, be able to view their upcoming schedule and completed workouts, and edit their workouts as needed.  

## Project Work Distribution:

Matthew: I focused mostly on the front end design and building of the website, while helping as needed on the server side routing, logic, and DB pulling for rendering data to the front end.  i also did my fair share of testing and bug reporting :). I was also responsible for connecting and configuring the FullCalendar App on our website, as displayed on the user dashboard page.  

Jennifer: I focused mostly on the backend implementation. I connected the project to the MongoDB, set up routing related to user register, login, workout creation and edition. Also, I helped with the frontend setting and built the user profile page. Working with Matthew, we deploy our website on the Heroku and connect it with MongoDB Atlas.
